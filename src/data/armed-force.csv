The dams secured vital water supplies to German war production facilities, and they were fiercely protected, however, the skill of the aircrew, the development of the ‘bouncing bomb’ and the capabilities of the four-engine Avro Lancaster ensured a successful mission and an incredible morale boost to Great Britain. Known as ‘Operation Chastise’, the raid is one of the most famous air operations of the Second World War and was immortalised in the 1955 film ‘The Dambusters’, ensuring the legacy of the brave airman and the Lancaster Bomber were never forgotten.The Bremont Dambuster timepiece takes design cues from many of the military watches of the 1940s and the 42mm chrono features a mono pusher movement and date function, ‘aviator’ style hands across the dial and sub-dials and a red centre second chrono hand for readability. The military aesthetic is enhanced by Bremont’s iconic ‘51’ vintage lume, set against a ‘Dirty Dozen’ inspired black military dial.""","Not currently in stock. Please contact us to confirm future availability.      As part of its partnership with Britain’s Ministry of Defence (MoD), Bremont is commemorating the 80th anniversary of the Lancaster Bomber first seeing service in 1942, and the subsequent Dambusters Raid in 1943, paying tribute to this iconic Second World War aircraft and courageous mission with the release of the Limited Edition Bremont Dambuster. This special 42mm chrono timepiece takes design cues from many of the military watches of the 1940s and  uniquely, each one comes with an elegant set of silver Avro Lancaster Cufflinks incorporating aluminium from the original airframe of Lancaster B.VII NX611 ‘Just Jane’."
